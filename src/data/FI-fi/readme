This based on https://www.tuomas.salste.net/suku/kela-etunimet.html#M1 research. 
There are a lot of ready-made names. The purpose of this is to initially generate one or more names for use by the program. 
The lists grow over the years, so the solution needs to be developed. This first list is only 2 names long. 
This seconds list is only 14 names long. Maybe last list hundreds of thousands names. And Later add middle names and lastnames.
